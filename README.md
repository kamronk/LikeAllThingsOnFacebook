# LikeAllThingsOnFacebook
A bookmarklet to like everything currenlty loaded into any facebook page

The javascript can be ran from a browser console, or I have it fashioned into a bookmarklet here on my blog where you can drag and drop it into your bookmarks:
http://kamronk.com/like-all-the-things/

It works with all the like buttons currenly loaded into the page your looking at. In technical terms, the like buttons need to be in the active DOM when executed. 

After executing (by clicking bookmark or running in browser console) you are free to do other things on your computer and the web.
